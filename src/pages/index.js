            <strong>Brixton Ramblers Lodge #3347</strong> was formed in 1909 by several members of the Brixton Ramblers Cycling Club. A number of these daring gentlemen had made a name for themselves racing penny farthings in the UK and around the world. The lodge held meetings at Freemasons Hall in Covent Garden, and afterwards dined at the Cafe Royal on Regents Street.

          <p>
            <strong>Freemasonry is one</strong> of the world’s oldest social and charitable organisations in the world. Its roots lie in the traditions of the medieval stonemasons who built our cathedrals and castles.

For Freemasons, there are four important values that help define their path through life: Integrity, Friendship, Respect and Charity.
          </p>
          <ul className="feature-icons">
            <li className="icon fa-shield">Integrity: Building good people</li>
            <li className="icon fa-users">Friendship: Building together</li>
            <li className="icon fa-globe">Respect: Building unity</li>
            <li className="icon fa-heart">Charity: Building compassion</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In today’s world filled with uncertainty, these principles ring as true as they have at any point in the organisation’s history.

            <strong>Brixton Ramblers Lodge </strong> currently meets several times a year at Mark Masons Hall, in the comfortable surroundings of St James's, right next door to St James's Palace.
            We have an active social calendar and regularly engage in charitable events. We are currently raising money to fund new 'super ladders' for the London Fire Brigade.

                London is a fantasic place to be a Freemason.  Indeed, Freemasonry was founded here in 1717, and there is a large and diverse masonic community with many lodges to visit around the city.
